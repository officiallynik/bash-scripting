cmd args is not a data stream
rest are std data stream

Standard Data Streams can be redirected and are identified using their stream number.

Redirection of the standard output of one command to the standard input of another command is known as piping.

Redirecting Standard Output
--> Standard output is stream number 1. There are 2 methods to redirect standard output. 
	==> The long form, using the stream number:
		cmdName -opts args 1 > dest
	==> Or the short form, with no stream number:
		cmdName -opts args > dest


Redirecting Standard Error: 
--> Standard error is stream number 2.
	==> Here is how to redirect standard error 
		cmdName -opts args 2 > dest
	==> Standard error can be redirected at the same time as standard output:
		cmdName -opts args 1 > out_dest 2 > err_dest

Redirecting Standard Input: 
--> Standard Input is stream number 0. There are 2 methods to redirect standard Input. 
	==> The long form, using the stream number: 
		cmdName -opts args 0 < in_src
	==> Or the short form, with no stream number:
		cmdName -opts args < in_src
