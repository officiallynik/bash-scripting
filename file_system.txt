Wildcards and Regular Expressions 
--> Wildcards are symbols with specific meanings to the shell. 
	==> * --> Matches anything, regardless of length. 
	==> ? --> Matches anything, but for one place only.
	==> [options] --> Matches any of the options inside for 1 place only. 
 
Regular expressions are patterns that can be used to match text. In Linux, they are used to allow a user to make rather generic expressions about what files they want a command to operate on.

These 3 wildcards are incredibly versatile and will cover an exhaustive amount of your regular expression requirements. 


Creating Files and Directories 
==> touch <file> --> creates a empty file in current folder
==> mkdir <directory> --> creates a new directory in current folder

Deleting Files and Directories
==> rm <file> --> remove a file
==> rm -r <directory> --> remove a directory
==> rm -i --> removes using a interactive panel
==> rmdir <empty directory> --> only remove empty directories


Editing Files with the Nano Editor
Nano is a versatile terminal-based text editor. It comes with a built-in toolbar of various commands and all one needs to know in order to use these options are the meaning of 2 special symbols. 

^ --> ctrl key on the keyboard
M- --> This is the “meta” key on your keyboard. Depending on your keyboard layout this may be the ALT, ESC, CMD key. T


The Locate Command
The locate command searches a database on your file system for the files that match the text (or regular expression) that you provide it as a command line argument. 

If results are found, the locate command will return the absolute path to all matching files. 

For Eg, locate *.txt  -->  will find all files with filenames ending in .txt that are registered in the database

The locate command is fast, but because it relies on a database it can be error prone if the database isn’t kept up to date

==> Locate -S --> Print information about the database file.
==> sudo updatedb --> Update the database. As the updatedb command is an administrator command, the sudo command is used to run updatedb as the root user (the administrator)
==> Locate --existing --> Check whether a result actually exists before returning it.
